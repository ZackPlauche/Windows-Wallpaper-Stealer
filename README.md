# Windows Wallpaper Stealer
You know those nice wallpapers you see your Windows Lockscreen,
but you're unable to find them in your folders?

If you do find them, you feel you have to go through a manual process
to change the name of each one just to find which ones are actual images?

Well, my program automates that process and organizes it into a
nice, clean folder :)
